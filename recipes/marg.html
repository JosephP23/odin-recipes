<h2>
Hot and Spicy Margarita
</h2>

<p>
A spicy margarita is a vibrant twist on the classic cocktail, igniting the taste buds with a fiery kick. It builds upon the traditional margarita's foundation of tequila, lime juice, and orange liqueur, but adds chili peppers for a thrilling heat. The intensity can be customized by using different peppers, from the mild jalapeño to the scorching habanero. This invigorating drink is perfect for those who crave an adventurous and bold flavor experience.
